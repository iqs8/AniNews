deploy with "func azure functionapp publish newsletter-sender" from root directory

better cuz show errors, using gui from extensions will say deployed but can have errors

will break if you have pip dependencies it can't resolve like pygame or something 
(be aware of all pip modules ur using, try not to use freeze)
